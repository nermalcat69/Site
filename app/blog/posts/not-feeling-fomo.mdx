Be Me, It's 2024 and I'm throwing tantrums as usual about how things should be and confused about life at the
same time with a lot of self esteem issues. Especially came from not being able to focus on studies especially
people around me considered me as a dumbass considering i was not in the JEE rat race.

Dealing with a father who can't comprehend my tantrums and getting slapped was a norm and i wouldn't complain
about it considering he can't understand a person who's negative for a specific period of time and i was one of
them.

I'd portray my father as a positive person who hates negativity at all costs even if it's from his own son. Never
got slapped for my academics because he considered academics as not the best measure of intelligence/future.

Actually some of you might be wondering about the programming rat race, but actually i started being on the
computer before i even knew what we could do with it.

Started with a computer with no internet and just a few games. Later getting into Minecraft and then later
wordpress development for the money and wanted to start my own blog with a domain which i bought from godaddy.

I used to feel fomo about every single thing was happening around me and i was not a part of it. Especially when
it was about money and no i didn't feel fomo around girls but I'd explicitly say this dating women is pointless
and waste of time(saying this after dating 4 women and one being 2 years older than me).

The fear of missing out for me was money, tech related stuff and not going to college.

Humans created problems for themselves and societal norms are just unnecessary and morals have standards and the
world is doomed (i really don't know why i said this but yes you can make conclusion of this in both negative and
positive connotation).

## Having Supportive Parents and Losing Friends

My bond with my family is so deeply rooted that if someone tries to break me by their words I don't really mind
considering the only words that matter to me are from my family. Not being rude but their validation has been the
only thing that has kept me going.

Advocates for using spaces argue that it ensures consistent code appearance across different editors, tools, and platforms. Because a space is a universally recognized character with a consistent width, code indented with spaces will look the same no matter where it's viewed. This consistency is crucial for maintaining readability and avoiding formatting issues when code is shared between team members or published online.

Additionally, some programming languages and style guides explicitly recommend spaces for indentation, suggesting a certain number of spaces (often two or four) per indentation level. Adhering to these recommendations can be essential for projects that aim for best practices in code quality and readability.

## Suffering is a Choice

On the other side of the debate, proponents of tabs highlight the flexibility that tabs offer. Because the width of a tab can be adjusted in most text editors, individual developers can choose how much indentation they prefer to see, making the code more accessible and comfortable to read on a personal level. This adaptability can be particularly beneficial in teams with diverse preferences regarding code layout.

Tabs also have the advantage of semantic meaning. A tab is explicitly meant to represent indentation, whereas a space is used for many purposes within code. This distinction can make automated parsing and manipulation of code simpler, as tools can more easily recognize and adjust indentation levels without confusing them with spaces used for alignment.


## Conclusion

While the spaces vs. tabs debate might not have a one-size-fits-all answer, it underscores the importance of consistency, readability, and team collaboration in software development. Whether a team chooses spaces, tabs, or a hybrid approach, the key is to make a conscious choice that serves the project's needs and to adhere to it throughout the codebase. As with many aspects of coding, communication and agreement among team members are paramount to navigating this classic programming debate.
