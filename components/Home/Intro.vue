        I'm Fayaz, I work as a software, product engineer and designer from
        Bengaluru, India. I specialize in building web applications and sites
        using Javascript, React, Vue &amp; Node. I've procrastinated building this
        website for years but finally it's here, I've carved out my own little
        nook on the internet to share my silly experiments, nifty projects, and
        thoughts (mostly about tech and design).

      <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
        By day, I'm a Fullstack Developer at
        <a href="https://headshotpro.com" target="_blank" class="underline">Headshotpro</a>, and
        by night (and weekends), I'm busy tinkering with some random tool or app
        that I am building.
